/** \brief Simple structure for an OpenCV Mat with deep copy constructor and assignment operator.
*
* This class encapsulates a `cv::Mat` and provides custom assignment operator and
* copy constructor to perform deep copy of matrix data too.
*
* This is because the `cv::Mat` assignment operator and the copy constructor
* just copy the Mat header but not the matrix data.
*
* This class is useful for Mats buffering. For example:
* - `std::queue::push(cv::Mat)` just creates a copy of `cv::Mat` header in the queue.
* - `std::queue::push(MatCapsule)` creates a deep copy of `cv::Mat` in the queue.
*
* \tparam TAdditionalStorage Here you can attach your own data type to hold any kind of information.
* In case your data type contains simple types, like a structure, you can forget about copying.
* If your data type holds any pointers or complex data type, you have to take care
* its copy constructor and assignment operator.
*
* \see

/** \brief Thread Safe Queue
*
* \author
* pkQueueTS - http://pklab.net/index.php?id=395
* Copyright (C) 2016 PkLab.net all rights reserved.
*
* This is a thread safe queue, multiple producer multiple consumer.
* It's based on [std::queue](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/queue) with single lock.
* A [condition_variable](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable)
* with time-out is used to wait for new data.
*
* ## A thread safe queue for OpenCV Mats
*
* This class can be used to manage queue of [OpenCV Mats](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d63/classcv_1_1Mat.html).
* Thanks to [Automatic Memory Management](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/dfb/intro.html) of `cv::Mat`
* and C++/STL memory recycling, use of `std::queue` with `cv::Mat` is memory effective.
*
* Unfortunately `cv::Mat` can't be used directly as element because its assignment operator and copy constructor
* just copy the Mat header but not the matrix data. A simple solution is to encapsulates `cv::Mat`
* into a structure or class and to write adequate assignment and constructor. The template class
* MatCapsule_ (or its simple alias `MatCapsule` ) is provided here to this purpose.
*
* Definitely you can write:
*
* \snippet pkQueueTS_TestSimple.cpp pkQueueTS_BasicUsage
*
* ## Additional storage
*
* The template class MatCapsule_ allows to attach any kind of additional storage to the capsule.
* For example you can have:
*
* \snippet pkQueueTS_TestSimple.cpp pkQueueTS_Additional_storage
*
* ## Memory statistics
*
* You can easily measure memory usage and allocations performed while using this class.
* Just write your own `OnPush` event handler and collect wanted measurement (see pkQueueOnPushBase).
*
* For example you can collect all addresses of pushed elements using a simple `std::map` as below:
*
* \snippet pkQueueTS_TestSimple.cpp pkQueueTS_Stats
*
* Please see http://pklab.net/?&id=396 for a detailed example and analysis
